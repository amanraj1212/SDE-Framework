1) compile time polymorphism/early binding/static binding:
change in num of args or type of args.
int f(int x, int y);  float f(int x, int y): error 

compile time polymorphism (method overloading)
runtime polymorphism (method overriding)

2) Multiple inheritance: Son inherit from Father,Mother
Hierarchial inheritance: Son and Daughter inherit from father
Multilevel inheritance: Grandparent, Parent and Child

3) In C++, class itself can't be public , private or protected like in Java.

4) In C++, public members of a class can be accessed from anywhere, any 
folder as long as .h file is declared.

5) In Java package is not just a folder unless we define the file within the 
folder with package statement.
src/
    Navbar/
            A.java: contains: package Navbar;
    Footer/
            B.java: contains package Footer
We say A.java is n package Navbar and B.java is in package Footer.

6) In Java only one top level public class and in this case file name 
must be same(case sensitive)

7) class A{

}
In Java by default it has default acess level: package-private;
accessed within the same package.

8) Top level class in java cannot be private or protected.
Only nested class can be private or protected.

9) if a class is declared public, it can be accessed:
from any other class
from any other package
anywhere in the project
provided that it is imported properly.

10) Note: even if class is public its members(variables/methods) must also 
be accessible.
public class A{
    void disp() // package-private method
}
if another package tries to call disp, it won't work.

11) In java, a protected member(variable or method)
is accessible inside the same package.
is accessible in other packages only through inheritance.

12) In C++, only the current class and friend functions can access the 
private and protected members.

13) In C++:
class E{
    public: int a;
    protected: int b;
    private: int c;
}
# public inheritance:
class F:public E{};
Member in E     Becomes in F
public a        public
protected b     protected
private c       not accessible

# protected inheritance:
class F:protected E{};
Member in E     Becomes in F
public a        protected
protected b     protected
private c       not accessible

# public inheritance:
class F:private E{};
Member in E     Becomes in F
public a        private
protected b     private
private c       not accessible

Trick: public inheritance-> keeps original visibility
       protected inheritance -> everything becomes protected
       private inheritance -> everything becomes private 

14) Constructor chaining in java and c++; diff in python;

15) super k.w in java is a reference variable that is used to refer immediate
parent class obj.
super -> used to refer immediate parent class instance var or instance 
method;
super() -> used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

16) Multilevel inheritance
key: curr class method will be called until unless specified with 
::(in c++) or super(in java); code in pg 25 sheets.

17) Multiple inheritance: in sheets after pg 25 sheets; explicit call 

18) firiend func: declare inside class and define anywhere just like a normal
function.

class class_name{
    friend datatype func_name(arguments);
};

19) Inheritance: "is a" relation ship;
class Animal{}
class Dog extends Animal{}
Dog is a Animal -> Animal d = new Dog();
Animal is not a dog -> Dog d = new Animal (error)

20) Java is polymorphism by default
    C++ is polymorphism by choice.
    pg: 28,29 sheets vvi(runtime polymorphism code)
diff output in c++ and java.

21) to call overriding function of a child class and not parent class 
we define virtual func in parent class in c++.

22) we cannot have a virtual constructor.

23) constructor can be private. used in creation of singleton class; 
only one instance of a class.

24) virtual functions cannot be a static members.
virtual void show()=0; // pure virtual function.

25) a class containing pure virtual function cannot be instantiated 
and sunch classess are c/s abstarct base class.

26) a class that is declared with abstract k.w is c/a abstract class 
in java.

27) abstract void printstatus();

28) int java const k.w is not there so we use:
static final float pi = 3.14;

29) interface in java: it has static constant and abstract method only.

30) class <- class (extends)
    interface <- class (implements)
    interface <- interface (implements)

31) Exception: an object thrown at runtime.

32) design patterns and extra solid and useful stuffs: pg 32 onwards.

33) no return type in constructor, not even void.

34) composition/aggregation : define "has a" relationship
class Engine{}
class Car{
    Engine e;
}
Car has an engine.

35) static member func can only access other static member or static func of 
class, not private or public or protected members.

36) constructors cannot be friend functions.

37) diamond problem in c++: point 36 cp copy from prev page;
imp: only one copy of base class will be inherited in child class;
it is done via virtual k.w;

38) class C:public A, public B;
order of execution: A,B,C;

class C:public A, virtual public B
order of execution: B,A,C

39) static call in java and c++ that are not overridden and virtual are resolved by reference type
class Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent show");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Child show");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent obj = new Child();
        obj.show();
    }
}

op: Parent show

in c++:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Parent {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Parent show";
    }
};

class Child : public Parent {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Child show";
    }
};

int main() {
    Parent* obj = new Child();
    obj->show();
}

op: Parent show

40) In C++, static data members must be defined outside the class unless they are inline (C++17) or certain const integral types.

If you write:

class A {
public:
    static int x;   // Declaration only
};

This is only a declaration, not definition.

You MUST define it outside:

int A::x = 10;   // Definition (memory allocated here)
