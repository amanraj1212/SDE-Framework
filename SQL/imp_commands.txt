1) In DBMS we cannot create relationship between tables but in RDBMS we can.

2) To sort values of a specific column
select * from Emp
order by ename desc;

3) Unique key
do not allow duplicates; allow null;
There can be multiple unique key per table but only one f.k per table;
null != null in sql; null denotes missing value not duplicates;
eg: email varchar(100) unique;
email if provided has to be unique else null.

4) Primary key
do not allow nulls; only one pk; poly cols can be p.k but one is recommended.

5) Aliases: temp name given for column and table.
select s.name from Student
select s.name from Student as s

6) Not permanently but shown as a separate column
select name,cost,cost+100 from Student

7) select distinct name from student

8) add multiple column to an existing table
alter table student
add column city varchar(10),
add column mobile int;

9) change column nmae and datatype
alter table Items
change column name ename varchar(20),
change column name roll int;

10) To modify datatype or size of data only and not name
modify column roll int(10);

11) create table Student
(
    roll int primary key,
    name varchar(10) not null;
)

12) To delete a column
alter table student
drop column roll;
some rdbms do not allow it.

13) to delete all data from table but keep table
truncate table my_table;

14) to delete a table from the database
drop table table_name

15) to delete a database
drop database db;

16) Update statement is used to update existing records in a table
update Emp
set emp_name = 'arjun',salry=3500
where empid=101;
// where is important else all records will be replaced with given value.

17) delete a record from table
delete from Student
where ename='aman' and eid=105

18) to delete all records 
delete from emp;

19) diff between delete from emp vs truncate table emp;
dml; ddl
empty table but keep auto increment counting; reset everything like a fresh start

20) copy old table from new table within same db
create table new_table like old_table;
insert into new_table select * from old_table;

21) '' from diff db: syntax in pg 11 of sheet

22) count(col_name): num of non-null values
count(*): num of records in table.
select count(*) from Emp;
select count(distinct name) from emp

23) mid(col_name,start,length) or substring('','','')

24) gropy by: arrange rows in groups then apply agg funcs
select name, MIN(salary) from emp
GROUP BY name

25) HAVING Clause(hmesha group by k saath)
select name,min(fees) from studentgroup by namehaving min(fees)>2

26) one to many: 1 dept many employees

27) more table more query time

28) p.k in one table is f.k in other;
refrences is used for syntax pg:15
f.k can be null; they can be non-unique;
f.k name can be different than from p.k

29) jab tak child table hai tab tak parent table ko delete nahi kar skte
(reason: fk hai)

30) delete record in parent table:
cannot delete unless you delete that record from child table.
hence: we use on delete cascade clause: it auto deletes records from
child table;

using on delete cascade the complete record from child table was gettting
deleted, we want only to get null in f.k col and rest record to remain there;
therefore we use : on delete set null;

31) do table ko join karne se pehle dono mai se kisi ek mai p.k hona chaiyae.

32) study join from sheet;
join is by default inner join hence write join or inner join both works.

33) where, group by, having, order by: all in one place
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY total_employees DESC;

34) view: to reuse logic; virtual table based on select query.
create view rich_fees 
AS
Select * from Student 
where fees>1;

now reuse: select * from rich fees

to delete views: drop view rich_users.
